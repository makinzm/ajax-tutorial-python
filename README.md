# Ajax Tutorial

I try to understand [Ajax (programming) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29)

```shell
uv run python app.py
```

# Technology

- [Fetching data from the server - Learn web development | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Fetching_data)

I think Ajax is a technique for creating fast and dynamic web pages but `fetch` is the modern way to do it.
(If this is not correct, please let me know.)

So, I will use `fetch` to create a simple web page that fetches data from the server.
